# Nepremicnine Scraper and notifier

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Change the config.py file by entering in your email adresses and a gmail generated API key.
Also you can change the parameters of the URL in the config file to fit whatever you are looking for.

Run
Navigate to this directory.
```bash
bash setup.sh
python3 scraper.py
```
run the bash script on the first run only. I suggest you make a cron tab or add a while loop with timeouts if you want to automate this.
